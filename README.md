NOTE: As this project hasn't been worked on in some years, and the current dependencies have security vulnerabilities, I have commented all requirements in the requirements file. These should be updated if this project is resurrected.
If you choose to install this project for any reason without working on updating the dependencies, you should not expose it to any external networks or untrusted input.
